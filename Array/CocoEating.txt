Problem: Koko Eating Bananas

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas; the i-th pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed k. Each hour, she chooses some pile and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them and does not eat more during that hour.

Koko wants to finish all bananas before the guards return.

Task: Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

Intuition:
- Use binary search on k (the eating speed). For a given k, simulate the total hours needed using ceiling division per pile.
- If the hours needed are <= h, try smaller k; otherwise, increase k.

Complexity:
- Time: O(n log M), where M is max(piles)
- Space: O(1)

Java Solution (unchanged):
class Solution {
    public boolean isPossible(int[] arr,int speed, int h){
        long count=0;
        int d;
        int r;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            if(arr[i]<=speed){
                count=count+1;
            }
            else{
                d=arr[i]/speed;
                r = arr[i]%speed;
                if(r!=0){
                  count=count+d+1;  
                }
                else{
                count=count+d;
                }
            }
        }
        return count<=h;
    }
    public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {
        int low=1;
        int high=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int ans;
        int mid;
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<piles.length;i++){
            high=Math.max(high,piles[i]);
        }
        ans=high;
        while(low<=high){
            mid=(low+high)/2;
            if(isPossible(piles,mid,h)){
                ans=Math.min(ans,mid);
                high=mid-1;
            }
            else{
                low=mid+1;
            }
        }    
        return ans;
